Tindog project for Angela's Boostrap chapter
Using HTML CSS and intermediate  Boostrap only.
The main idea in this Tinder for dogs is a responsive page for big mid small and phone screens .
In this chapter i manages to learn more about Boostrap libary featurs such as Hamburger Nav bar , Carousel builed-in classes and more.
At this momment i am feeling that this site has much more real-page appearance .
