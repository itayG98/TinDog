## Tindog project for Angela's course Boostrap chapter

Using HTML CSS and intermediate Boostrap only. The main idea in this Tinder for dogs is a responsive page for big mid small and phone screens . In this chapter i manages to learn more about Boostrap libary featurs such as Hamburger Nav bar , Carousel builed-in classes and more. At this momment i am feeling that this site has much more real-page appearance .
